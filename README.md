# Over View

The goal of this project is to develop a simple 2D physics engine to function as a physics module for the Gorgon Game Engine, and it would give Gorgon the ability to develop games backed up with physics simulation.
So far the engine is only a mass-aggregate physics engine, it doesn't have the capability to simulate rigid bodies (To be added later in version 2).

This repo only contains the miscellaneous files, however, the full code of Gorgon is located at
