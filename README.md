The goal of this project is to develop a simple 2D physics engine to function as a module for the Gorgon Game Engine.
So far the engine is only a mass-aggregate physics engine, it doesn't have the capability to simulate rigid bodies (To be added later in version 2).

This repo only contains the miscellaneous files, however, the full code of Gorgon is located at
